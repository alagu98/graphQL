# Getting Started

## Introduction

The GraphQL Drupal module lets you query or mutate (update/delete)  any content or configuration using the official GraphQL query language. This is an extremely powerful tool which opens the door for Drupal to be used in a multitude of applications.



## Who is this module for? 

Anyone who wants to get JSON data out of Drupal. 

Just a few examples of where the GraphQL module could be used:

* Decoupled Drupal applications with a javascript front-end (React, Angular, Ember, etc), 
* Twig Templates (Drupal theming)
* Mobile applications that need a persistent data store
* IOT data storage

## Hello World (Quick Start)

1. Familiarize yourself with the GraphQL language. The official GraphQL docs are very well written. 
http://graphql.org/learn/
2. Install the module and enable GraphQL, this will also enable GraphQL Core

3. Login and navigate to `/graphql/explorer` 
(Configuration > Web Services > GraphQL > Schemas > Explorer)

    This will bring you to the GraphiQL explorer. 

4. **Read the comments** and then enter the following query in the left pane: 

     ```javascript
     query {
       user: currentUserContext{
         ...on UserUser {
           name
         }
       }
     }
     ```

5. Press `Ctrl-Space` and you should see something like the following display in the right pane: 
    
    ```javascript
    {
      "data": {
        "user": {
            "name": "admin"
      }
    }
    ```

6. Congrats! You just figured out how to execute your first GraphQL query. This query is displaying the current logged in user, you. 


**NOTES:**
* The GraphiQL explorer is your friend, itâ€™s amazing. You will most likely use the GraphiQL explorer to build and test more complicated queries. 
* GraphQL is introspective, meaning that the entire schema (data model) is known up front. 
* You can use GraphiQL to explore your way through the data and configuration, once you know the basic GraphQL syntax. 
* The `... UserUser` in the query above is a fragment which exposes all of the fields on the UserUser entity to us. Inline fragments like this can be a very powerful way to explore the schema.
