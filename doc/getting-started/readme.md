# GraphQL for Drupal

This module lets you craft and expose a [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) schema for [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/8).

It is is built around [https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQL](https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQL). As such, it supports  
the full official GraphQL specification with all its features.

You can use this module as a foundation for building your own schema through  
custom code or you can use and extend the generated schema using the plugin  
architecture and the provided plugin implementations form the sub-module.
